# NGINX LDAP (NGINX_AUTH_MODE=ldap) can support LDAP, LDAPS, or LDAP+StartTLS.
#   For StartTLS, set NGINX_LDAP_TLS_STUNNEL=true to issue the StartTLS command
#   and use stunnel to tunnel the connection.
NGINX_LDAP_TLS_STUNNEL=false
# stunnel will require and verify certificates for StartTLS when one or more
#   trusted CA certificate files are placed in the ./nginx/ca-trust directory.
#   For additional security, hostname or IP address checking of the associated
#   CA certificate(s) can be enabled by providing these values.

# Whether or not nginx should use HTTPS. This is almost CERTAINLY what you want.
#   The only case you may want to set this to false is if you're using another
#   reverse proxy in front of NGINX. Even if set to 'false', NGINX will still
#   listen on port 443 (it just won't be encrypted). If you change this, you'll
#   probably want to change "0.0.0.0:443:443" to something like
#   "127.0.0.1:80:443" in the ports section for the openresty service and
#   change "https://" to "http://" in its healthcheck.
